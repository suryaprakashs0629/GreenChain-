# GreenChain-
ABOUT THIS PROJECT : 
The Problem

Farmers usually get exploited → middlemen eat the profit, farmers get peanuts.

Consumers don’t know if the product they’re buying is authentic, organic, or fairly priced.

Shopkeepers & distributors sometimes mix fake/low-quality produce.

No proper way to trace the journey of food from farm → distributor → retailer → customer.

💡 The Solution (Your Project Idea)

Build a blockchain-based system where every step (from farmer selling to consumer buying) is recorded in a tamper-proof ledger.

Each participant (farmer, distributor, retailer, customer) is a stakeholder.

They log in to a website/app (your GREEN CHAIN portal).

A QR code on the product lets consumers scan and see full details: origin, price, quality, journey.

Smart contracts automate payments & ensure fair pricing.

🛠️ Technical Flow (super simple)

Farmer Login → Uploads details of harvest (crop type, quantity, base price).

Distributor Login → Buys produce, updates transport & storage details.

Retailer Login → Sells it in shops, updates stock.

Customer Login → Scans QR code, sees entire journey & verifies authenticity.

Blockchain → Makes sure all this info is secure, transparent, and can’t be faked.

🌍 Expected Outcome

Farmers get fair prices & no cheating.

Consumers get trust in what they buy.

Government & regulators can monitor supply chain better.

Builds confidence in AgriTech + Blockchain fusion.
